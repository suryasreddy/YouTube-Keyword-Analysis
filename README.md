# Unlocking YouTube Success: Analyzing the Impact of Title Keywords and Length on Video Performance

## Introduction
### Background and Problem Statement:
YouTube has evolved into one of the most influential platforms for content creation, where videos from a vast range of genres can reach millions of viewers worldwide. As a long-time YouTube viewer, I've witnessed how certain trends and content styles gain viral traction, often driven by compelling video titles and thumbnails. This personal experience has sparked my curiosity about what makes a YouTube video successful, particularly the role that video titles play in attracting viewers.

In this project, I aim to explore the relationship between YouTube title keywords, title lengths, and video performance. Specifically, I will analyze how certain keywords might correlate with higher view counts and likes, and whether the length of a title influences engagement. Understanding these patterns could provide valuable insights for content creators looking to optimize their titles to attract more viewers. My ultimate goal is to not only uncover actionable data but also to apply these insights toward potentially starting my own YouTube channel in the future.
