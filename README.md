# Unlocking YouTube Success: Analyzing the Impact of Title Keywords and Length on Video Performance

## Introduction
### Background and Problem Statement:
YouTube has evolved into one of the most influential platforms for content creation, where videos from a vast range of genres can reach millions of viewers worldwide. As a long-time YouTube viewer, I've witnessed how certain trends and content styles gain viral traction, often driven by compelling video titles and thumbnails. This personal experience has sparked my curiosity about what makes a YouTube video successful, particularly the role that video titles play in attracting viewers.

In this project, I aim to explore the relationship between YouTube title keywords, title lengths, and video performance. Specifically, I will analyze how certain keywords might correlate with higher view counts and likes, and whether the length of a title influences engagement. Understanding these patterns could provide valuable insights for content creators looking to optimize their titles to attract more viewers. My ultimate goal is to not only uncover actionable data but also to apply these insights toward potentially starting my own YouTube channel in the future.

### Tools Used:
- **Python**: Youtube Data Scraping
- **Excel**: Data Cleaning
- **SQLite**: Advanced Queries for Data Analysis 
- **Tableau**: Building Dashboard

## Web Scraping
I used Python and the YouTube Data API to scrape video metadata, specifically focusing on keywords like "challenge," "reaction," and "vlog." These three genres are among the most popular on YouTube, making them ideal for analyzing title keyword effectiveness. The googleapiclient.discovery library was utilized to interact with the YouTube API, allowing me to pull essential data such as video titles, view counts, like counts, and publication dates. I built a custom function to retrieve video details by making two API calls: one to search for videos using specific keywords, and another to fetch detailed statistics for those videos. The process included gathering video IDs from the search results and then fetching the full details (title, views, likes, and dates) for each video in batches of 50. By compiling this data into a structured format using pandas, I was able to efficiently export it into Excel for further analysis. This approach ensured I collected relevant and up-to-date data directly from YouTube, forming the foundation for my analysis on title keywords and performance.

Below is the Python function used for scraping video data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API. This function searches for videos based on specified keywords, fetches video details, and aggregates them into a list that includes the video title, view count, like count, keyword, and published date.

```python
def fetch_videos_data(keyword):
    # Search for videos with the given keyword
    search_request = youtube.search().list(
        part="snippet",
        q=keyword,
        type="video",
        maxResults=50  # Fetch top 50 videos
    )

    search_response = search_request.execute()

    # Collect video IDs
    video_ids = [item['id']['videoId'] for item in search_response['items']]

    # Fetch video details
    videos_request = youtube.videos().list(
        part="snippet,statistics",
        id=",".join(video_ids)
    )

    videos_response = videos_request.execute()

    # Extract required data
    videos_data = []
    for item in videos_response['items']:
        title = item['snippet']['title']  # Get video title
        view_count = item['statistics'].get('viewCount', 0) # Get the view count
        like_count = item['statistics'].get('likeCount', 0) # Get the like count
        published_at = item['snippet']['publishedAt']  # Get the published date

        videos_data.append([
            title,
            view_count,
            like_count,
            keyword,  
            published_at  
        ])

    return videos_data

# Fetch top 50 videos for "challenge," "reaction," and "vlog"
challenge_videos = fetch_videos_data("challenge")
reaction_videos = fetch_videos_data("reaction")
vlog_videos = fetch_videos_data("vlog")

# Combine the data
all_videos = challenge_videos + reaction_videos + vlog_videos
